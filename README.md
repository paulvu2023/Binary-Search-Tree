This project challenged me to explore the difficulties of using recursion and led me to a much deeper understanding of both Binary Search Trees and recursion. At the beginning of the project, it took me a ton of effort and time to solve simple recursion problems, but towards the end, I learned to write recursive functions intuitively.
