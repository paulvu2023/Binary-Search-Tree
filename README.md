## Features

AchieveFlow allows you to:

- **Create Binary Search Trees**: Simply type in numbers with spaces in between.
  
- **Visualize**: Watch as your Binary Search Tree transforms.
  
- **Effortless Node Insertion**: Seamlessly add nodes using numeric input.
  
- **Easy Node Deletion**: Easily delete nodes using numeric input.
  
- **Tree Insights**: Discover Tree information at a glance.
  
- **Node Insights**: Calculate any nodes' height or depth.
  
- **Rebalance Tree**: One-click tree rebalancing.

This project challenged me to explore the difficulties of using recursion and led me to a much deeper understanding of both Binary Search Trees and recursion.
